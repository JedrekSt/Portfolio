# Portfolio
Hello! Here is my Protfolio. I've listed couple of projects that i've made during my scientific research and spare time projects. The Potfolio is divided into 3 parts:
1. Scientific projects 
    - This section includes projects completed as part of scientific exploration, though not intended for publication. They showcase my programming skills and proficiency in Python, especially with libraries like PyTorch and NumPy.
2. Scientific Publications 
    - Here, I present research code and computational tools developed during the publication process. These projects reflect the rigorous analytical work behind my scientific papers.
3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    - A collection of machine learning projects, primarily focused on self-implemented algorithms. These projects highlight my deep understanding of ML theory as well as my ability to translate that theory into clean, functional code.
4. LeetCode Solutions
    - In this section, youâ€™ll find my solutions to various algorithmic challenges on LeetCode, primarily written in Java. These demonstrate my skills in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving under time constraints.
