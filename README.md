# My Portfolio 
Hello :wave:! Welcome to my portfolio. Here, I’ve gathered a selection of projects developed both during my scientific research and in my spare time. The portfolio is divided into four main sections:
## <b>Scientific Computing Projects</b> :microscope: :
This section includes projects completed as part of scientific exploration, though not intended for publication. They showcase my programming skills and proficiency in Python, especially with libraries like PyTorch and NumPy.
- <a href = "https://github.com/JedrekSt/Quantum_Random_Walks" target="_blank"> Quantum Walks </a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/JedrekSt/PhaseTransitions/tree/main" target="_blank">Multi-Spin Systems </a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/JedrekSt/Toy_Hubbard_model" target="_blank">Toy model for Hubbard Hamiltonian (in Polish)</a>
## <b> Scientific Publications </b> :bookmark_tabs: :
Here, I present research code and computational tools developed during the publication process. These projects reflect the rigorous analytical work behind my scientific papers.
- <a href = "https://github.com/JedrekSt/Quantum-Synchronizing-Words-Resetting-and-Preparing-Qutrit-States" target = "_blank"> Quantum Synchronizing Words Resetting and Preparing Qutrit States </a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/JedrekSt/Quantum_Synchronization_Protocol" target = "_blank"> Quantum Resetting Protocols Based on Synchronising Words </a>
## <b> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning </b> :robot: :
A collection of machine learning projects, primarily focused on self-implemented algorithms. These projects highlight my deep understanding of ML theory as well as my ability to translate that theory into clean, functional code.

## <b> LeetCode Solutions </b> :jigsaw: :
In this section, you’ll find my solutions to various algorithmic challenges on LeetCode, primarily written in Java. These demonstrate my skills in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving under time constraints.
